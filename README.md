# Thymio's Motion Control

This is the project of the Basics of Mobile Robotics (BMR) course at EPFL (MICRO-452).<br>

The goal of this project was to enable the Thymio robot to follow an optimal path to reach a goal while avoiding global and local obstacles.
This project consisted of five components of vision, global navigation, local navigation, filtering, and motion control.<br>

The Python implementation and the project report are accessible in this repository.
