    "The local navigation section is useful in order to make the robot avoid local obstacles that are positioned in real time during the global navigation. In particular, Thymio uses its proximity sensors to avoid such obstacles that are put in its path at any point and at any moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, when Thymio detects a local obstacle, our program immediately enters in the local navigation mode by calling the function \"local_avoidance\". Actually, this happens only when we are in the global navigation mode and the obstacle detected is not a global one. The function used is \"check_obstacles\": it checks an half disc of the occupancy grid going from -90° to +90° (with a step of 10°) with respect to the Thymio's frontal direction and for each angle a distance from 0 to 30cm (with a step of 2cm) with respect to Thymio's position. If there are not expected obstacles, meaning that we find in the occupancy grid checked all 0 (1: global obstacle, 0: no global obstacle), then we enter the local navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to decide the minimum sensors' threshold above which the robot gets too close to the obstacle, we made a careful calibration, testing many different possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows what we check before entering the local avoidance: only if the obstacle is unexpected we enter it."

    "### Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The function \"local_avoidance\" manages the obstacle avoidance problem. It takes as input the optimal path which consists in the previous and the following optimal coordinates with respect to the actual Thymio's position. \n",
    "The first useful thing to do is to define the constants that will be used in the function, such as the minimum sensors' threshold (same as before), the distance to make the robot move forward and the angles of rotation. All these parameters were chosen empirically, by testing the algorithm several times with a trial and error approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now focus the attention on our strategy: we decided to make the robot avoid an obstacle by always following its left side (left wall following with direction). Hence, we make the robot rotate left until it does not detect the obstacle anymore (with any of the frontal sensors). In order to do this we continuosly update the sensors' values in a while loop, that ends only when the just mentioned condition is verified. We noticed that for a correct execution of the code, it was useful having a boolean variable \"command_finish\" that is true only when the previous command is executed. In this way the robot handles just one order at a time. Moreover, in order to avoid Thymio's overloading, after each command we decided to add a \"sleep\": also in this case we tried lots of sleep time's values in order to select the best. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the robot is positioned correctly, it is ready to advance and rotate right until it crosses the global path.\n",
    "Also in this case we enter a while loop that ends only when the just mentioned condition is verified. Obviously, since it continuously moves forward and rotates right, there is the possibility that Thymio rotates right too much: this is why we need another while loop (inside the previous while) that checks if the extreme right sensor of the robot detects the wall. If this is the case, we correct its position by rotating left until the sensor does not detect the obstacle anymore.\n",
    "Actually, at the beginning of each loop we also make use of the function \"check_returned_to_global_path\" that checks if the robot reaches the optimal path. If this does not occur, the robot can move forward and rotate right.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below we can observe the logic:\n"

    "### How to turn back to global navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "The function \"check_returned_to_global_path\" gets the robot's last position from the Kalman estimation and the previous and the following vertices of the optimal path with respect to the actual position of the robot. In this way we can compute the straight line (slope, intercept) between these two coordinates and thus verifying if Thymio reached the global path, by plugging in the equation of the straight line its actual position. We decided to allow a certain error margin, as visible in the code. Finally, when we reach the optimal path, the function returns global_path=True and the algorithm switches to the global navigation mode."

    "### Local avoidance test\n",
    "\n",
    "Here it is reported part of the code used for the local navigation. In order to execute correclty the algorithm, the robot must be close to an object. Since we are testing this function alone, we can have neither the actual estimated position (by Kalman), nor the actual occupancy grid (by vision), nor the actual full path (by global navigation). This is why we simply call the function local_avoidance without verifying if there are global obstacles or if the optimal path is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "PLEASE NOTE that in order to make the robot stop it is necessary to press the central button: since in this test we are not using global navigation, it is useless to verify if we cross the optimal path. Hence, the condition global_path will never be verified and the algorithm will never stop. Obviously, since in the demonstration we have all the sections merged, the actual position changes very fast and as soon as it reaches the global path, we exit the local navigation mode."
