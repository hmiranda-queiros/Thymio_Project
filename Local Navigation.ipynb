    "# Local obstacle avoidance\n",
    "\n",
    "While navigating, Thymio uses its proximity sensors to avoid physical obstacles that can be put in its path at any point and any moment. Our obstacle avoidance algorithm works for rectangular parallelepipeds and cylinders.\n",
    "When Thymio detects a local obstacle, our program immediatly enters in local navigation mode.\n",
    "First, we have a function \"obstacle_avoidance\" that manages the local avoidance problem. We decided to make the robot avoid an obstacle by always following its left side. Hence, if the robot detects the obstacle with its left sensors, it must rotate in order to follow correctly the left side of the wall. At this point, it rotates again until it does not detect the obstacle anymore. Now, it is ready to advance and rotate until it crosses the global path. Actually, we make use of another constructor: \"check_global_obstacles_and_global_path\" that checks if the robot reaches a map limit, a global obstacle, or the optimal path. Thus, after getting the last position of the robot, the algorithm checks if we have reached a map limit or if a global obstacle is nearby (through the occupancy grid). If this is the case, it returns obstacle=True and \"obstacle_avoidance\" adjusts the robot's position. Then we get the previous and the following vertices of the optimal path with respect to the actual position of the robot. In this way we can compute the straight line between these coordinates and thus verifying if Thymio reached the global path. If yes, the function returns global_path=True and the algorithm switches to the global navigation mode."
